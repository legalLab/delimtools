## IMPORTANT

This software is under active development, and as such cannot be assumed to be free of bugs or poor functionality. Always inspect results carefully. If you find a problem, please report it with as much detail as possible in [Issues](https://github.com/LegalLab/delimtools/issues). Unfortunately in its current form, some of the functions (`abgd_tbl()`, `asap_tbl()` and `mptp_tbl()`) will not work natively on Windows operating systems, only on Unix (MacOS, Linux). This is because third party binaries (executable programs) are required. We have implemented a Windows solution by importing results from the webservers that are commonly used to run these analyses, e.g. [https://bioinfo.mnhn.fr/abi/public/abgd/abgdweb.html](https://bioinfo.mnhn.fr/abi/public/abgd/abgdweb.html), [https://bioinfo.mnhn.fr/abi/public/asap/asapweb.html](https://bioinfo.mnhn.fr/abi/public/asap/asapweb.html), and [https://mptp.h-its.org/](https://mptp.h-its.org/). There are also difficulties with installing R required package dependancies to run `gmyc_tbl()` and `bgmyc_tbl()` because these are no longer under development and available on CRAN, and must be installed from archived sources. Please refer to [https://legallab.github.io/delimtools/articles/install.html](https://legallab.github.io/delimtools/articles/install.html) for instructions on how to install.

## Overview

The official GitHub repository for the R package `delimtools` (Bittencourt et al., in prep.).

`delimtools` provides helper functions for the analysis of single-locus species delimitation methods such as GMYC ([Monaghan et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syp027)), bGMYC ([Reid & Carstens, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-12-196)), mPTP ([Kapli et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx025)) and ASAP ([Puillandre et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13281)). These software run multiple different platforms (e.g. R, Unix, webservers), and also do not output their results in a consistent format to allow easy comparison. To address these shortcomings we have developed a suite of functions to standardise and simplify generating single-locus species delimitations.

## Dependencies
Delimtools mainly depends on the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and 
[ggtree](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/ggtree) packages. To install these, run 
the command lines below:

Install `tidyverse`:
```{r, eval= FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")

```

Install `ggtree`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("ggtree")

```

## Installation

To install `delimtools` you may execute the following commands. We recommend the usage of
the latest CRAN release always.

Latest stable version from CRAN
```{r, eval= FALSE}
install.packages("delimtools")

```

Development version from GitHub:
```{r, eval= FALSE}
devtools::install_github("LegalLab/delimtools")
```

Or a specific version via renv:
```{r, eval= FALSE}
renv::install("LegalLab/delimtools@v0.1.0")
```

## Examples

Here, we will demonstrate a single-locus species delimitation analysis on a _Geophagus_ eartheater cichlid dataset ([Ximenes et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12443)) using a variety of methods. For full details please see the GitHub repository accompanying this R package at [github.com/boopsboops/delimtools-testing](https://github.com/boopsboops/delimtools-testing).
